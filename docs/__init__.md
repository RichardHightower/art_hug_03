# Code Analysis for `src/__init__.py`

## 1. Top-level Overview

This file serves as the initializer for the `src` package. It is not meant to be executed directly. It is automatically processed when the `src` package or one of its modules is imported.

The file's primary purposes are:
- To mark the `src` directory as a Python package, allowing modules within it to be imported using the `src.` prefix.
- To define a package-level `__version__` attribute.

There are no entry points for direct execution.

## 2. Global Sequence Diagram

A sequence diagram is not applicable here as this file does not contain any executable logic or functions that are called externally. It is passively used by the Python import system.

## 3. Function-by-Function Analysis

There are no functions, methods, or classes in this file.

## 4. Architectural Mapping

This file is a standard part of Python's packaging system. It doesn't belong to a specific architectural layer (like presentation, business, or data) but rather is a foundational element of the project's structure.

## 5. Diagram Generation

Diagrams are not applicable for this file due to its simplicity.

## 6. Code Listing with Explanations

```python
"""
Chapter 03 Examples: Tokenization and Text Processing Fundamentals
"""

__version__ = "0.1.0"
```

- **`"""Chapter 03 Examples..."""`**: This is a docstring that provides a brief description of the package's contents.
- **`__version__ = "0.1.0"`**: This line sets the version of the package. This is a common convention in Python packaging and helps with version management.
